# LightzoneFX
This is recreation of Lightzone with a modern and reactive user interface written in JavaFX.

Actually it is only a picture viewer / video file viewer with some small editing features and metadata support.

Stay tuned until the other management features will be released and the edit modul from LightZone is ported over
The target actually is to get better managment features and not to create another photo editor.

The reason to create such a software was the fustration with already existing photo app such as ON1, Darktable, ...

Short history:
Lightroom was my primary solution until Adobe decided to goto the montly payment train which I do not want to follow. All other programs I have found on the net (opensource and commercial ones) have performance issues in the management modules. Therefore I want to create an easy software to manage my photo library.
